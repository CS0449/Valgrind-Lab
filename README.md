## Background
The [Valgrind tool suite](https://valgrind.org/) provides a number of debugging and profiling tools that help you make your programs faster and more correct. The most popular of these tools is called `Memcheck`. It can detect many memory-related errors that are common in C and C++ programs and that can lead to crashes and unpredictable behavior. This lab is meant to familiarize you with Valgrind so that you can use it for future projects while debugging.

## Introduction

1. Connect to your Virtual Machine and ensure that "Valgrind" is installed. You can run `valgrind --version` to see if it is installed.
	```shell-session
	$ valgrind --version
	valgrind-3.22.0
	```
  	If Valgrind is not installed, install it using the `apt` package manager:
	```sh
	sudo apt install valgrind
	```

2. Change directories to the one we created for the work for this class, and clone this repository.
  	```
	git clone https://github.com/CS0449/Valgrind-Lab
	```
	The repository contains three C programs inside the `src` directory: `quick-start.c`, `very-buggy.c`, and `leak.c`. We will use these programs to demonstrate how to use Valgrind to detect memory errors.

3. Change into the `src` directory, and follow the directions below while reading: [The Valgrind Quick Start Guide](http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/quick-start.html).

	```bash
	gcc -g quick-start.c -o ./quick-start
	valgrind --leak-check=yes ./quick-start
	```

## Part 1: Errors detected by Valgrind
4. Follow the directions below while reading: [http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/mc-manual.html](http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/mc-manual.html). Focus on Section 4.2: Explanation of error messages from MemCheck.
	```bash
  	gcc -g very-buggy.c -o ./very-buggy
  	valgrind --leak-check=full --track-origins=yes ./very-buggy
	```

5. Valgrind should report 7 errors. The URL given above describes 8 types of errors discovered by MemCheck.  
Write how many errors of each type Valgrind discovers in the above example code.
   - [ ] Illegal read / Illegal write errors
   - [ ] Use of uninitialized values
   - [ ] Uninitialized values in system calls
   - [ ] Illegal frees
   - [ ] Inappropriate deallocation function
   - [ ] Overlapping source and destination blocks
   - [ ] Fishy argument values
   - [ ] Memory leak detection


6. Make reasonable modifications to `very-buggy.c` and remove all memory errors.
	- If buffers overflow, they should be extended.
	- If values are not initialized, they should be initialized to 0.
	- If there is a leak the memory should be freed appropriately, etc.
	- Once you are done, Valgrind should not display any errors when run.

## Part 2: Memory Leak Analysis
7. Follow directions  below

	```sh
	gcc -g leak.c -o ./leak
	valgrind --leak-check=full --show-reachable=yes ./leak
	```

8. Look at the **LEAK SUMMARY** section reported by Valgrind.
	- Note that there are 7 blocks leaked in total categorized into: definitely lost, indirectly lost, and still reachable. Those 7 blocks correspond to the 7 nodes in the tree created by `leak.c`.
	- On a piece of paper, draw a pictorial diagram of the tree. On the diagram, mark nodes that are definitely lost with the letter ‘`D`’, nodes that are indirectly lost with the letter ‘`I`’, and nodes that are still reachable with the letter ‘`S`’.
	- Read Section 4.2.10 of the manual to get a description of each type of leak.

9. Make modifications to `leak.c` to insert appropriate `free()` calls to remove all direct and indirect memory leaks. Once you are done, Valgrind should not display any errors when run.
